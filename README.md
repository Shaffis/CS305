Artifact: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report
Client Summary:
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a thorough assessment of their software's security 
vulnerabilities. The client wanted to ensure that their software systems were protected against potential threats and 
that any existing vulnerabilities were identified and documented. The main issue that the company wanted to address was 
the security of their software applications, ensuring they were resilient to potential attacks and complied with industry 
standards for secure coding practices.

What I Did Well:
During the vulnerability assessment, I excelled at identifying and documenting the software vulnerabilities present in the 
Artemis Financial system. I methodically used various tools and techniques to uncover potential security risks and documented 
them in a clear and concise manner. This approach ensured that all identified vulnerabilities were easy to understand and 
provided a solid foundation for future mitigation efforts. Coding securely is critical because it protects sensitive data, 
maintains the integrity of software systems, and upholds the trust of clients and users. Secure software adds significant 
value to a company's overall well-being by reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing the company's reputation for 
reliability and security.

Challenges and Helpful Aspects:
One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was accurately distinguishing between true vulnerabilities and false 
positives. However, this challenge was also a valuable learning experience, as it required me to deepen my understanding of 
the security tools and techniques used during the assessment. The process of analyzing and verifying each potential 
vulnerability improved my ability to critically assess security reports and reinforced the importance of a meticulous 
approach to software security.

Increasing Layers of Security:
To increase the layers of security in the Artemis Financial system, I implemented several measures, including updating 
libraries with known vulnerabilities and configuring security settings to mitigate potential risks. In the future, I 
would continue to use tools like the OWASP Dependency-Check to assess vulnerabilities and leverage automated testing 
frameworks to ensure that all security measures are effective and up to date. Deciding which mitigation techniques to 
use involves evaluating the potential impact of each vulnerability and considering the specific needs and context of 
the client.

Ensuring Functionality and Security:
After refactoring the code, I ensured that the software application remained both functional and secure by running 
comprehensive tests. These tests included both functional testing to ensure the application behaved as expected and 
security testing to verify that no new vulnerabilities had been introduced. Additionally, I reviewed the changes using 
static analysis tools to detect any potential security issues that may have arisen during the refactoring process.

Tools and Practices:
Throughout the project, I used several resources and tools that were invaluable in completing the vulnerability assessment. 
Notably, the OWASP Dependency-Check was instrumental in identifying known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. 
Additionally, I adhered to secure coding practices, such as input validation and proper error handling, which will be 
helpful in future assignments and tasks. These tools and practices not only enhanced the security of the software but 
also streamlined the development process.

Showcasing My Work to Employers:
This assignment demonstrates my ability to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment and implement secure coding 
practices, skills that are highly valued in the field of software development. By showcasing this work to future employers, 
I can highlight my expertise in identifying and mitigating security risks, my attention to detail, and my commitment to 
delivering secure and reliable software solutions. The artifact and my reflection on the process serve as evidence of my 
capability to contribute to the security and overall quality of software projects.
